Helping developers add professional-looking projects to their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!","Do I get a code review when I post my solution?":"Frontend Mentor is a collaborative learning community where everyone can give feedback to each other. If you'd like to receive feedback from the community, please be sure to post a question when you submit your solution. The more specific you can be, the better. Being clear with your questions means you're much more likely to receive valuable feedback from others.","Do you offer discounts?":"We don't offer any discounts on the Pro subscription beyond the regional discounts that we automatically apply. We have lots of free challenges, so we'd recommend using them. Then, if you feel you'll get value from the Pro subscription, you can upgrade.","Does the subscription auto-renew?":"Our subscriptions do auto-renew at the end of their term. You can easily manage your subscription by going to Settings > Billing. We send you an email reminder a few days before your subscription renews to make sure you don't get caught out.","How can I get help if I'm stuck on a challenge?":"The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there, so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated \"help\" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can [get an invite to our Discord server here](".concat(s.Vs,")."),"How do I delete my account?":'Go to Settings > Account > Delete Account. Be aware that clicking "Delete Account" will delete all your data, including associated data, like solutions, comments, etc., and cannot be undone.',"How do I delete my solution?":"Go to the solution page and click the vertical ellipsis menu at the top right of the title section. When the menu opens, you'll see an option to delete your solution.","How do I edit my solution?":"Go to the solution page and click the vertical ellipsis menu at the top right of the title section. When the menu opens, you'll see an option to edit your solution.","How do I generate a new solution screenshot?":'You\'ll see a "Generate Screenshot" button below the design comparison slider on the solution page. Clicking this will create a new screenshot.',"How do I start?":'You can [see all of our challenges here](/challenges). To start a challenge, click the "Start Challenge" button on the challenge page. This will take you to the Challenge Hub, where you can download the starter files, including a README file which will help you get set up. We\'d recommend starting with one of our newbie level challenges. You can then work your way up from there.',"How do I submit my solution?":"We'd recommend reading our [complete guide to submitting solutions](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) . If you get stuck and need help, please feel free to ask questions in our Discord server, and we'll help you submit your project.","How often are new challenges added?":"We launch a new challenge every two weeks. We alternate between free and premium challenge launches, so we launch one free and one premium challenge each month.","What does this platform do, and how will it help me?":"We provide front-end challenges that include professional web designs. These allow you to practice building websites in a realistic workflow. Taking these challenges will help you improve your skills, gain experience creating websites, and build up an incredible project portfolio. We also have a large community of developers, so it's a great way to meet other devs!","Is it free?":"The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that are premium and require a [Pro subscription](/pro) to access. It will say on each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to tell the difference.","Is there an official solution I can take a look at?":"We don't provide \"official\" solutions for the challenges. This is because there is no single perfect way to complete a challenge. Instead, you're encouraged to review other people's code in the community. You can learn so much by seeing how other people have approached the same challenges and giving them feedback.","Is there any way to sign-up other than GitHub?":"It's just GitHub at the moment. We only take the most basic information from your GitHub profile like email, username, profile picture, etc., and don't access your repositories. We do have plans to offer more sign-up options, so stay tuned.","I'm on the monthly subscription option and would like to upgrade to yearly. How can I do this?":"Please email [hi@frontendmentor.io](mailto:hi@frontendmentor.io) and we'll happily help you switch your subscription.","I want to use Frontend Mentor challenges in a commercial course/tutorial/project. Is this possible?":"We do offer commercial licenses. So if you'd like to use our challenges in a commercial project with no need for attribution, please get in touch at [hi@frontendmentor.io](mailto:hi@frontendmentor.io) for more information.","What are points for, and how does the points system work?":'Your "Mentor Score" is a rough gauge of your reputation on the platform. Earning more points can boost your exposure within the community and get you on the [Wall of Fame](/wall-of-fame). Click "Learn about our Wall of Fame" on the Wall of Fame for all the information.',"Do you offer refunds?":"We offer a \"fair use\" refund policy within 14-days of starting your first subscription. Fair use means that if you download one or two premium assets (designs, premium challenges) and decide it's not for you, we're happy to process a refund. After all, we want you to be satisfied with your purchase! But if you've downloaded three or more premium assets and then requested a refund, we reserve the right to say no. To request a refund, email [hi@frontendmentor.io](mailto:hi@frontendmentor.io) within 14-days of starting your subscription.","Why are there credits limits on the monthly subscription?":"Due to the downloadable nature of our Pro assets (design files, premium challenges), we need credit limits for monthly subscribers. Otherwise, someone could subscribe for a month, download everything, and immediately cancel. So we need the limits in place so we can function as a business. The limits we've chosen allow a lot of practice on a month-to-month basis. You can download 5x design files for our free challenges, and you can take 2x premium challenges.","Why does my solution screenshot look different to the live version?":"We use a headless Chromium browser to take solution screenshots, so check your solution using Chrome to see how it looks. You might need to update your code to improve cross-browser consistency. If the screenshot still looks different, please email us at [hi@frontendmentor.io](mailto:hi@frontendmentor.io), and we'll look into it.","What happens when my subscription expires?":"When your subscription expires, all private solutions are made public. You go back to having five screenshot credits per month. If you have a yearly subscription, your design and premium credits reset to zero. If you have a monthly subscription, unused credits remain on your account until you use them.","What is the difference between the desktop-design, mobile-design, and desktop-preview images in my starter code?":"The desktop-design and mobile-design images show you how the layout should look at large and small screen sizes. The desktop design is 1440px wide, and the mobile design is 375px. However, try building projects to look good on all screen sizes. The desktop-preview image is a preview image used in the README file. You don’t need to reference this while building the project."},r=o(85893),n=o(99036),i=o(67294),l=o(85860);let c=({children:e,heading:t})=>{let[o,s]=(0,i.useState)(!1);return(0,r.jsxs)("details",{className:"bg-neutralWhite border border-neutralLightGrey rounded-lg",open:o,children:[(0,r.jsx)("summary",{className:"cursor-pointer list-none [&::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden",onClick:e=>{e.preventDefault(),s(!o)},children:(0,r.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex gap-4 items-center justify-between px-5 py-4",children:[(0,r.jsx)("span",{className:"font-secondary font-semibold",children:t}),(0,r.jsx)(l.Z,{className:"text-lg",name:o?"minus":"plus",style:"solid"})]})}),(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"border-t border-neutralLightGrey px-5 py-4 text-neutralDarkGrey",children:e})]})};var d=o(7339);let h=({question:e})=>(0,r.jsx)("li",{children:(0,r.jsx)(c,{heading:e,children:(0,r.jsx)(d.Z,{children:h.questions[e]})})});h.questions={};var u=o(30003);let m=(0,n.tv)({base:["flex","flex-col","gap-5","w-full"]}),p=({children:e,className:t,heading:o,headingTag:s="h2"})=>(0,r.jsxs)(o?"section":"div",{className:m({class:t}),children:[o&&(0,r.jsx)(u.H,{className:"text-center",level:"2",tagName:s,children:o}),(0,r.jsx)("ul",{className:"flex flex-col gap-3",children:e})]});p.FAQ=h,p.FAQ.questions=a;var g=p},70705:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,{Z:function(){return l}});var s=o(85893),a=o(99036),r=o(11890),n=o(30003);let i=(0,a.tv)({base:["container-xl","flex","flex-col","items-center","gap-8","tablet:flex-row"],variants:{isEven:{true:["tablet:flex-row-reverse"]}}}),l=({children:e,emoji:t,heading:o,image:a,number:l})=>{let c=l%2==0;return(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:i({isEven:c}),children:[(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"max-w-[25rem] tablet:basis-1/2 tablet:max-w-none",children:a}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col gap-4 items-start max-w-prose tablet:basis-1/2 tablet:gap-6",children:[t&&(0,s.jsx)(r.Z,{className:"bg-neutralLightestGrey w-[5rem] text-3xl",children:t}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative",children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.H,{level:"3",children:o}),!t&&l&&(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"absolute-center font-bold font-secondary text-neutralMidGrey text-[7.5rem] top-0 -z-10",children:l})]}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{className:"text-neutralDarkGrey",children:e})]})]})}},45042:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,{Z:function(){return l}});var s=o(85893),a=o(99036),r=o(30003),n=o(571);let i=(0,a.tv)({base:["text-lg"]}),l=({children:e,className:t,icon:o,heading:a,headingLevel:l="1"})=>(0,s.jsx)(n.Z,{className:"px-5",children:(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-md flex flex-col gap-6 py-9 text-center",children:[o&&(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"text-4xl",children:o}),(0,s.jsx)(r.H,{className:"text-primaryBlue",level:"1",tagName:`h${l}`,children:a}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:i({class:t}),children:e})]})})},2429:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,{Z:function(){return c}});var s=o(85893),a=o(99036),r=o(22160),n=o(30003),i=o(85860);let l=(0,a.tv)({base:["py-8","rounded-xl",'mobile:bg-[linear-gradient(hsla(0,0%,0%,0),theme("colors.neutralLightestGrey"))]',"mobile:px-5"]}),c=({className:e,children:t})=>(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:l({class:e}),children:[(0,s.jsx)("h2",{className:"sr-only",children:"Testimonials"}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"container-sm flex flex-col gap-5 desktop:container-xl desktop:flex-row",children:t})]});c.Card=({avatar:e,children:t,name:o,title:a})=>(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"basis-0 bg-neutralWhite flex flex-col flex-grow flex-shrink gap-5 items-center rounded-lg p-5 text-center mobile:p-6",children:[(0,s.jsx)(i.Z,{className:"text-primaryBlue text-[3.75rem] opacity-20",name:"quote-left",style:"solid"}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{className:"tablet:text-lg desktop:my-auto",children:t}),(0,s.jsx)(r.Z,{image:e,size:"lg"}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col gap-1 items-center",children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.H,{className:"text-primaryBlue",level:"2",tagName:"span",children:o}),(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"text-neutralDarkGrey text-sm",children:a})]})]})}},function(e){e.O(0,[7339,2888,9774,179],function(){return e(e.s=75557)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
